# Rainforcement

This folder contains a complete implementation of a Reinforcement Learning project focused on predicting user purchases using the `iphone_purchase_records.csv` dataset. The project demonstrates the use of RL algorithms, model training, evaluation, and deployment using Python.

## Folder Structure

- `app.py` — Streamlit or Flask app for interactive model inference and visualization.
- `main.py` — Main script for training, evaluating, and saving the RL model.
- `model.joblib` — Serialized trained model for fast loading and inference.
- `Rainforcement.ipynb` — Jupyter notebook with step-by-step explanation, data exploration, model training, and results visualization.
- `test.py` — Script for unit testing and validating model performance.
- `iphone_purchase_records.csv` — Dataset used for training and evaluation.
- `.ipynb_checkpoints/` — Jupyter notebook checkpoints (auto-saved versions).

## Key Features

- **Data Preprocessing:**
  - Cleans and prepares the `iphone_purchase_records.csv` dataset for RL tasks.
  - Feature engineering and normalization.

- **Model Training:**
  - Implements advanced RL algorithms (e.g., Q-learning, SARSA, or custom approaches).
  - Hyperparameter tuning and model selection.

- **Evaluation:**
  - Performance metrics (accuracy, reward, etc.)
  - Visualizations of learning curves and policy improvements.

- **Deployment:**
  - Interactive app (`app.py`) for real-time predictions and user interaction.
  - Model loading from `model.joblib` for fast inference.

- **Testing:**
  - Automated tests in `test.py` to ensure reliability and correctness.

## How to Run

1. **Install Dependencies**
   - Ensure Python 3.7+ is installed.
   - Install required packages:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```
     *(If `requirements.txt` is missing, install common packages: numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, streamlit, joblib)*

2. **Train the Model**
   - Run `main.py` to preprocess data, train the RL model, and save it:
     ```bash
     python main.py
     ```

3. **Run the App**
   - Launch the interactive app:
     ```bash
     streamlit run app.py
     ```
     *(Or use Flask if implemented)*

4. **Test the Model**
   - Run unit tests:
     ```bash
     python test.py
     ```

## Notebooks

- `Rainforcement.ipynb` provides a detailed walkthrough of the RL workflow, including:
  - Data exploration
  - Model implementation
  - Training and evaluation
  - Visualizations and insights

## Dataset

- `iphone_purchase_records.csv` contains anonymized purchase records for RL modeling.
- Typical columns: user_id, purchase_amount, features relevant to RL.

## Customization

- Modify `main.py` to experiment with different RL algorithms or reward structures.
- Update `app.py` to enhance the user interface or add new features.
