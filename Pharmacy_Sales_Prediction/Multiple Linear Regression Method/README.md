## Overview
This project applies multiple linear regression to predict the profit of startups based on R&D Spend, Administration, Marketing Spend, and State. The workflow covers data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model building, evaluation, and saving the trained model for future use.

## Dataset
- **File:** `Startups_Dataset_Sample.csv`
- **Description:** Contains startup data with features such as R&D Spend, Administration, Marketing Spend, State, and Profit.

## Project Structure
```
main.py                       # Main script for training and evaluating the model
Model.ipynb                   # Jupyter notebook for exploratory data analysis and modeling
Multiple_Regression_Model.ipynb # Additional notebook for model experimentation
model.pickel                  # Serialized trained model
Startups_Dataset_Sample.csv   # Dataset file
```

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```powershell
   git clone https://github.com/Devnath03/ML-Multiple-Regression-Demo-Model.git
   cd ML-Multiple-Regression-Demo-Model
   ```
2. (Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```powershell
   python -m venv venv
   .\venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```powershell
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
- Run the main script:
  ```powershell
  python main.py
  ```
- Explore the Jupyter notebooks for step-by-step analysis:
  - `Model.ipynb`
  - `Multiple_Regression_Model.ipynb`

## Model Training
- Data is loaded and preprocessed.
- Features are selected and split into training and test sets.
- A multiple linear regression model is trained on the data.
- The trained model is saved as `model.pickel` for reuse.

## Model Evaluation
- The model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as RÂ² score and Mean Squared Error (MSE).
- Visualizations and analysis are provided in the notebooks.

## Deployment
- The trained model (`model.pickel`) can be loaded for predictions on new data.
- Example usage is provided in `main.py`.

## Results
- The project demonstrates how multiple regression can be used to predict business outcomes.
- Key findings and visualizations are included in the notebooks.
