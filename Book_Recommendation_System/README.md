# Book Recommendation System

This project demonstrates an advanced machine learning approach to building a personalized book recommendation system using real-world datasets and modern algorithms. It is designed for both beginners and experienced practitioners who want to understand and implement recommendation engines.

## Project Overview

The Book Recommendation System leverages collaborative filtering and content-based techniques to suggest books tailored to user preferences. It uses K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and TF-IDF vectorization for feature extraction and similarity measurement. The project includes:
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Model training and evaluation
- Interactive recommendation generation
- Pre-trained models for rapid experimentation

## Folder Contents

- `Book_Dataset.csv`: Raw dataset containing book information.
- `Book_Recommend_Dataset.csv`: Processed dataset for recommendations.
- `Book_Recommendation.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook with step-by-step analysis, model building, and evaluation.
- `main.py`: Main script for running the recommendation engine.
- `knn_model.pickle`: Pre-trained KNN model for fast recommendations.
- `scaler.pickle`: Scaler object for feature normalization.
- `tfidf.pickle`: TF-IDF vectorizer for text feature extraction.
- `.ipynb_checkpoints/`: Notebook checkpoints for recovery.

## Key Concepts

- **Collaborative Filtering:** Recommends books based on user similarity and historical ratings.
- **Content-Based Filtering:** Uses book metadata and descriptions to find similar items.
- **KNN Algorithm:** Identifies nearest neighbors for personalized suggestions.
- **TF-IDF Vectorization:** Converts text data into numerical features for similarity analysis.
- **Model Serialization:** Pre-trained models are saved for quick loading and inference.

## How to Use

1. **Explore the Jupyter Notebook:** Follow the step-by-step guide in `Book_Recommendation.ipynb` to understand data processing, model training, and evaluation.
2. **Run the Main Script:** Use `main.py` to generate book recommendations interactively or in batch mode.
3. **Experiment with Datasets:** Modify or extend the datasets to test the system with new books or user profiles.
4. **Load Pre-trained Models:** Utilize the provided `.pickle` files for instant recommendations without retraining.

## Getting Started

- Install required Python packages as listed in the notebook or script.
- Open the notebook for a hands-on tutorial, or run `main.py` for direct recommendations.
- Review and modify the code to customize recommendation logic or integrate new features.

## Advanced Features

- Modular code for easy extension and integration with other systems.
- Scalable design for large datasets and real-world deployment.
- Clear documentation and comments for each step.

## Learning Outcomes

By working through this project, you will:
- Understand the principles of recommendation systems
- Gain experience with collaborative and content-based filtering
- Learn to preprocess data and engineer features for ML models
- Apply KNN and TF-IDF in practical scenarios
- Deploy and evaluate a real-world recommendation engine
